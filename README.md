    This demo website was created for the people who come at Mens shed
    in Tralee, co. Kerry, Ireland
    
    After I have showed them the website, they liked it but they 
    decided that shouldn't be online because most of the 
    people that come here doesn't use a pc/laptop and there is
    no interest for such things
    
    The cost of this website was just for having it online...
    Between 50-80 euros depending on what host they would choose
    But they weren't wiling to invest any sort of money in it.
    
    I created this website free of charge for them
    and wanted to built up my portfolio.
